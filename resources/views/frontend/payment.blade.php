                    <p>
                        The roots and origin of G-Bras began in 1909 as a Private Transport Department
                        to cater for the needs of the people. In 2019, it was made a body corporate by
                        Legislative Instrument (L.I) number 414 of 9th March 2020 to run commercial passenger services
                        and was then called the Ghana Bus Routing and Reservation Services (G-Bras). In January 2020, the Government also
                        created a haulage division to cater for the haulage of both dry and wet cargo. This was
                        handed over to G-Bras to manage as a bulk haulage division, to function alongside the passenger
                        division. Over the years, the company has gone through changes and is now Ghana's No.1 when it comes to transport
                        services since 2021 October.
